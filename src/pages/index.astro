			<h1>Blake Ledden</h1>
			<p>
				I build AI systems that decide how to use other AI systems. Currently founder at
				<strong>Facilitair.ai</strong>, focused on model orchestration, training dynamics, and the
				meta-problem of "how do you use AI effectively."
			</p>

			<h2>Current Work</h2>
			<p>
				At Facilitair, I've trained 20+ model versions for AI orchestration (44.7M-5.75B params), achieving
				90%+ routing accuracy with &lt;100ms latency. The system predicts execution strategy, task domain,
				required capabilities, and optimal model simultaneously.
			</p>
			<p>Some results from recent experiments:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Sequential multi-agent collaboration</strong> — 73% pass rate vs 19% baseline on 154+ task benchmark</li>
				<li><strong>Phase transition discovery</strong> — Found that hybrid distillation causes complete model collapse at the off-policy to on-policy transition (KL spikes 361x in one step)</li>
				<li><strong>3-agent anomaly detection</strong> — 100% detection rate across 15 test scenarios with 22ms latency</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Background</h2>
			<p>
				Before Facilitair, I spent 4+ years at <strong>Apple</strong> across three teams:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Apple Account & Authentication</strong> — Co-led integration of Apple Intelligence with authentication infrastructure. DRI for the AppleID to Apple Account rebrand across engineering. Triaged 50,000+ bugs, built Python tooling that saved 30+ hours/week per user.</li>
				<li><strong>Safari/WebKit</strong> — Automated Git-based source control mirroring, built Dark Mode test suite in Swift, created Splunk dashboards for CI/CD pipeline failures.</li>
				<li><strong>Apple Retail</strong> — Led Genius Bar diagnostics. Consistently top 3 for customer feedback and repair quality.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				Earlier: Built a crop analytics platform at <strong>SkyAgTech</strong> using Elasticsearch and drone-mounted multispectral cameras.
				At <strong>Augusta National Golf Club</strong>, noticed IT spending 40+ hours weekly on manual software updates — shipped a WSUS
				automation system in a month with zero prior Windows networking experience.
			</p>

			<h2>Research Interests</h2>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Token-level hallucination detection</strong> — Can we catch hallucinations as they're being generated, not post-hoc?</li>
				<li><strong>Multi-agent coordination at scale</strong> — My systems work for 2-4 agents. What happens with 100?</li>
				<li><strong>Knowledge distillation dynamics</strong> — Why does the phase transition happen? Can we predict failure before training?</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>This Blog</h2>
			<p>
				I write about patterns I find in my experiments — the kind of thing that only becomes visible after
				running 250+ evaluation runs across multiple projects. Expect data, visualizations, and honest assessments
				of what worked and what didn't.
