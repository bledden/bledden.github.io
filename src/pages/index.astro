			<h1>Blake Ledden</h1>
			<p>
				I build AI systems that decide how to use other AI systems. Currently founder at
				<strong>Facilitair.ai</strong>, focused on model orchestration, training dynamics, and the
				meta-problem of "how do you use AI effectively."
			</p>

			<h2>Current Work</h2>
			<p>
				At Facilitair, I've trained 20+ model versions for AI orchestration (44.7M-5.75B params), achieving
				90%+ routing accuracy with &lt;100ms latency. The system predicts execution strategy, task domain,
				required capabilities, and optimal model simultaneously.
			</p>
			<p>Some results from recent experiments:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Sequential multi-agent collaboration</strong> — 73% pass rate vs 19% baseline on 154+ task benchmark</li>
				<li><strong>Phase transition discovery</strong> — Found that hybrid distillation causes complete model collapse at the off-policy to on-policy transition (KL spikes 361x in one step)</li>
				<li><strong>3-agent anomaly detection</strong> — 100% detection rate across 15 test scenarios with 22ms latency</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Background</h2>
			<p>
				Previously 4+ years at Apple, mostly on authentication and developer tooling. Before that,
				a mix of startups and IT roles where I kept finding problems that could be automated and building
				solutions for them.
			</p>

			<h2>This Blog</h2>
			<p>
				I write about patterns I find in my experiments — the kind of thing that only becomes visible after
				running 250+ evaluation runs across multiple projects. Expect data, visualizations, and honest assessments
				of what worked and what didn't.
