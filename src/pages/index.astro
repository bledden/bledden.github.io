			<h1>Blake Ledden</h1>
			<p>
				I build AI systems that decide how to use other AI systems. Currently founder at
				<strong>Facilitair.ai</strong>, focused on model orchestration, training dynamics, and the
				meta-problem of "how do you use AI effectively."
			</p>

			<h2>Current Work</h2>
			<p>
				At Facilitair, I've trained 20+ model versions for AI orchestration (44.7M-5.75B params), achieving
				90%+ routing accuracy with &lt;100ms latency. The system predicts execution strategy, task domain,
				required capabilities, and optimal model simultaneously.
			</p>
			<p>Recent experiments (7 projects, 300+ runs, 10-seed statistical validation):</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Open Character Training</strong> — Constitutional DPO improves character alignment +39%, reduces adversarial break rate 65%→35%</li>
				<li><strong>Phase transition discovery</strong> — Hybrid distillation collapses at mode transition regardless of capability gap (KL spikes 361x in one step)</li>
				<li><strong>SL vs RL efficiency</strong> — Supervised learning converges in O(1) episodes, RL scales as O(n^0.89) for memorization tasks</li>
				<li><strong>Negative result</strong> — Token-level noise augmentation significantly hurts LLM training (p=0.0018, Hedges' g=1.57)</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Background</h2>
			<p>
				Previously 4+ years at Apple, mostly on authentication and developer tooling. Before that,
				a mix of startups and IT roles where I kept finding problems that could be automated and building
				solutions for them.
			</p>

			<h2>This Blog</h2>
			<p>
				I write about patterns I find in my experiments — the kind of thing that only becomes visible after
				running 250+ evaluation runs across multiple projects. Expect data, visualizations, and honest assessments
				of what worked and what didn't.
