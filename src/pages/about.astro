	<h2>How I Work</h2>
	<p>
		I treat every failure as a research question. When my first models collapsed, I didn't just try different
		hyperparameters — I instrumented everything, found the root cause (embedding quality), and fixed it systematically.
		When consensus voting underperformed, I ran controlled experiments to prove it and understand why.
	</p>
	<p>
		The pattern: start building, hit a wall, go deep enough to understand why, fix it, repeat. Six months of that
		compounds fast.
	</p>

	<h2>Technical Focus</h2>
	<p><strong>Languages:</strong> Python, TypeScript, Rust, Swift, Objective-C, JavaScript/Node.js, SQL, C/C++, Bash</p>
	<p><strong>Technologies:</strong> PyTorch, FastAPI, Docker/Kubernetes, Ray, PostgreSQL/pgvector, Redis, OpenRouter, LangChain, OAuth2, Next.js</p>
	<p><strong>Focus Areas:</strong> AI Agent Orchestration, Foundation Model Architecture, Multi-Agent Systems, Distributed Training, LoRA/QLoRA Fine-tuning, Vector RAG, GPU Computing, Model Evaluations, Hallucination Reduction, MCP Tooling</p>

	<h2>What I've Learned</h2>
	<p>
		After running 250+ ML evaluation runs, some patterns keep showing up:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Model selection matters more than training — test broadly before committing</li>
		<li>Mode collapse has a threshold — find it early with small experiments</li>
		<li>The 3B cliff is real — some tasks require minimum model capacity</li>
		<li>Hybrid distillation is fragile — the phase transition can destroy learning</li>
		<li>SL beats RL for memorization — use the right tool for the task</li>
	</ul>
